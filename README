NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::DOAP - create a doap.xml file for your project

SYNOPSIS
    In dist.ini:

       [DOAP]

    Or even:

       [DOAP]
       xml_filename = project.xml
       ttl_filename = project.ttl

DESCRIPTION
    This is a small plugin for Dist::Zilla, enabling you to bundle a DOAP
    file with your distribution.

  The Straight DOAP
    So what is DOAP? This explanation is lifted from Wikipedia
    <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOAP>.

    *DOAP (Description of a Project) is an RDF Schema and XML vocabulary to
    describe software projects, in particular free and open source
    software.*

    *It was created and initially developed by Edd Dumbill to convey
    semantic information associated with open source software projects.*

    *It is currently used in the Mozilla Foundation's project page and in
    several other software repositories, notably the Python Package Index.*

  Configuration
    This plugin has three settings that you can tweak in your "dist.ini"
    file:

    "xml_filename"
        The filename for DOAP output, serialized as XML. Defaults to
        "doap.xml". Set this to the empty string to disable XML output.

    "ttl_filename"
        The filename for DOAP output, serialized in the slightly more
        readable Turtle format. Defaults to undef. Set this to a filename to
        output some Turtle.

    "process_changes"
        A boolean indicating whether your "Changes" file should be processed
        to generate a release history. Defaults to 0 (no).

  Hints
    For the most part, everything should "just work". The plugin will figure
    out everything it needs from your "distmeta" (i.e. META.json) and
    "Changes" file (if it exists). Here are a few hints though...

    *   For this module to have the best chance of reading your changelog,
        format it as per CPAN::Changes::Spec.

    *   DOAP represents people as structured resources, while META.json
        represents them as strings. This module expects authors and
        contributors listed in META.json to conform to one of the following
        formats:

           Joe Bloggs (JOEB) <joe.bloggs@example.net>
           Joe Bloggs <joe.bloggs@example.net>
           Joe Bloggs

        (Assuming that "JOEB" is Joe's PAUSE login.)
